    "summary": "I'm a scientist who loves to work with big data, physical dynamics, and good people. I hold M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Coastal and Ocean Engineering from Oregon State University, and a B.S. in Environmental Engineering from Columbia University, which have provided me with a strong technical proficiency in machine learning, data science, physical modelling that is founded on a strong understanding of environmental dynamics. At Integral, I work cross-functionally in both data analytics and marine science engineering groups. In data analytics, I develop data pipelines and help to extract valuable insights from complex datasets. Simultaneously, I contribute significantly to coastal risk and resilience projects, leveraging my deep understanding of physical dynamics. I recognize that a team is only a strong as complementary and individual contributions, and am energized by working within strong teams. I have a passion for teaching and learning, which makes me an effective team player, technical collaborator, and increasingly becoming a bridge between technical and non-technical stakeholders.",
