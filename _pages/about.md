Hey everyone! I'm a data scientist/coastal scientist that loves the beach and the ocean. My work focuses on understanding the beach - and helping others understand the beach - through the lens of data. I have a strong technical foundation in nearshore coastal dynamics and machine learning from my PhD, and I've been working as a consultant in the coastal space with <a href="www.integral-corp.com"> Integral Corporation </a>

Within data science, I'm interested in using data to understand processes - can correlations and trends translate to understanding causation? I believe that data - and powerful data mining techniques - can unlock patterns that are otherwise imperceivable by using manual techniques alone. Tool development and automation follow, hopefully to augment and support data science research, ultimately resulting in even more powerful insights.

Data insights are only as valuable as they are understandable and useful to the people who need them most. Non-technical decision makers (read: policy makers, renewable energy developers) rely on data being understandable to make decisions. As a coastal resilence scientist, I act as a translator between the non-technical and the technical, helping non-technical folks mold their questions into questions specific to the data. I also create data visualizations, powerpoints, and write reports to distill relevant nuggets of information from datasets. 

In my free time, I love to be outside. My main hobby is surfing (shocker), but I also enjoy travelling and learning new things (new languages, new instruments, new sports, new foods).
