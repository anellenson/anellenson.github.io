Hey everyone! I'm a data scientist/coastal scientist that loves the beach and the ocean. My work focuses on understanding the beach and helping others understand the beach through the lens of data. I have a strong technical foundation in nearshore coastal dynamics and machine learning from my PhD, and I've been working as a consultant in the marine space with <a href="www.integral-corp.com"> Integral Corporation </a>

Within data science, I try to use data to understand processes and inform decision making - can correlations and trends translate to understanding causation? I believe that data - and powerful data mining techniques - can unlock patterns that are otherwise imperceivable with manual techniques alone. Tool development and automation follow naturally, hopefully to augment and support data science research and ultimately result in even more powerful insights. 

Data insights are only as valuable as they are understandable and useful to the people who need them most. Non-technical decision makers (read: policy makers, renewable energy developers) rely on data being easy to understand to make decisions. As a coastal resilence scientist, I act as a translator between the non-technical and the technical, helping non-technical folks mold their questions into questions specific to the data. I create data visualizations, powerpoints, and write reports to communicate relevant nuggets of information from datasets. I develop data solutions from start to finish by using a client's questions as the driver and iterating on deliverables with appropriate techniques within project constraints.

In my free time, I love to be outside. My main hobby is surfing (shocker), but I also enjoy traveling and learning new things (new languages, new instruments, new sports, new foods).
