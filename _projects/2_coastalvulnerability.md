<h3> Where should a coastal community focus their efforts to mitigate coastal flooding and erosion?</h3>

I performed a shoreline change analysis to determine which areas of the beach were historically most vulnerable to erosion, and relate the changes in shoreline to changes in climate patterns (like ENSO) and seasonal cycles.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/vulnerability_assessment/coastsat_trends_ENSO.png" title="Average Shoreline Positions" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

<div class="caption">

We found that the most variability occurred in the southern end of the beach, while the central and northern end were most stable. The beach was more eroded in the south during positive ENSO cycles.

If we look at the changes in shoreline position, we can find when the shoreline is moving seaward (accretion) and landward (erosion). Beach building mostly happened in the spring due to smaller waves bringing sand onshore, and most erosion happened in the winter with winter waves. This is pretty typical of most seasonal beach cycles.

We then ran models to project coastal flooding and erosion out to the future. We found that, for the future, if no action was taken to ensure beach stability, the most overtopping and erosion would occur primarily in the central and southern parts of the beach, which was consistent with the historical analysis.

Ultimately, we had a several conclusions and recommendations, which we presented a city meeting:


1) The sand is mostly confined within the system: the long term satellite analysis showed that long term trends of shoreline position were not detected.   
2) Vulnerability is highest in the southern end of the beach, especially during ENSO events when the beach is already likely to be eroded.   
3) Beach building or nourishment activities should occur in the spring when beach building is occuring naturally.
